Welcome, Teams! 👋

We’re super excited to build the future of Web3 with you at the EasyA Consensus Hackathon in Hong Kong! At our previous EasyA Consensus hackathons, we’ve given away millions in prizes and funding. And this time, we’re back even bigger and better. Welcome to Asia’s biggest hackathon.

With hundreds of top developers and traders, we’re looking for the best DeFi and Trading applications. you’ll learn more in 2 days than you’ve ever learnt before, and network with the best builders in the world. Past EasyA hackathon winners have literally gone on to multi-million dollar startups. Check out [this one](https://x.com/kwok_phil/status/1881411607768801617?s=46) that just raised $2.5m!

Consensus is the “The Super Bowl of Blockchain, the World Cup of Web3” according to Forbes. So this is your chance to get noticed by top VCs and recruiters! Our hackathon will take place at the heart of the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre at the heart of the city.

We’re on the hunt for the most promising early-stage builders in Web3, and even in AI x Web3 for our two-day hackathon. You could be just getting into Web3 for the first time, or building your next Web3 startup - we can’t wait to have you with us! 😎

If you’ve been to an EasyA hackathon before you’ll be familiar with this doc. Essentially, we’ve put it together to answer all the questions people typically have in the run up to our hackathons, but if there’s anything else you want to ask just ping us (hello@easya.io)!

See you soon!

> **Judging** (don’t worry - it’s not scary at all! 😄)
> 
- **WHEN** | Demo day will be on Thursday (see schedule above for precise timings).
- **HOW** | Judging will be done in-person on Thursday. **Finalists for the DeFi track will be selected to present in-person formally to everyone on stage (traders will not need to present)!**
- **PRESENTING** | If you’re selected to present, here’s how it will go:
    - 20 seconds to connect your computer to the projector.
    - 3 mins to present.
    - 1 min for Q&A.

If you go over time, points will be deducted from your team.

- **PRESENTING STRUCTURE** | Follow this structure when presenting:
    - First 30 seconds for each team member to introduce yourselves (which employer/university you’re from, which year, what you’re majoring in, etc). **Make sure you have a team slide, and that you each introduce your background/experience.**
    - Next 30 seconds to explain the problem you’re solving
    - Next 30 seconds to explain your solution and grand vision - show off how big this can get
    - Next 30 seconds showing off your demo - show off how much you achieved!
    - Next 30 seconds explaining how you used the relevant blockchain in your project
    - Final 30 seconds on future roadmap and what you’ll do next
- **CRITERIA** | Submissions will be judged by EasyA / company representative based on their technical merits as well as the quality of presentation.

See the track resources for specifics on how projects will be graded. However, in general, remember the following questions they’ll have in their minds: 

- Execution: Is the project usable in its current state? Is the user experience smooth? Does everything appear to work? Is it well designed?
- Usefulness: Is the idea practical? Is it something people would actually use? Can it actually be implemented?
- Learning: Did the individual or team stretch themselves and push the boundaries of learning in this space?
- Use of blockchain: Does the project use blockchain effectively? Does it understand why blockchains are useful, and what the unique benefits and limitations of the blockchain are?
- Deployment: Was the project successfully deployed on testnet/mainnet?

> **How to submit your project 🚀**
> 

Simply complete this submission form: https://forms.gle/PviFvSBZLmoksjmq8

> **Submission requirements ✅**
> 

**Projects must:**

1. Be built using one of the relevant blockchain’s technologies above
2. Be open source (and remain available as open source)
3. Include a short summary (<150 chars)
4. Include a full description (the problems it solves, how the technology was used to achieve it)
5. Include a technical description (what SDKs were used, and what features of the sponsor’s tech made this uniquely possible)
6. Include a link to the Canva slides used in the presentation (make sure you include a slide on your team, problem, solution, etc.). You must use Canva for your presentation (yes, this is a requirement).
7. Include a clear README on your GitHub repo explaining how your project works. This README must include:
    1. A demo video
    2. Screenshots of your UI
    3. Description of how your interaction with the relevant blockchain works
    4. A video with audio (e.g. a Loom video [like this](https://youtu.be/ZLKR4zE1o6U?si=6na7139wlVNkmJRa)) explaining how your project works, how the GitHub repo is structured, a demo of everything working etc. This is vital, so that the judges can review your project properly. Make sure you explain clearly how you satisfied point 7 above. This is a great example of a project README: https://github.com/mahir-pa/poap. Bonus points for if your video is well-edited!

Please make sure you follow the above requirements very carefully. If you do not satisfy them, you will not be eligible for a prize.

> **FAQs**
> 
- **Do I need to bring my computer?**

Yep - how else will you make your slides or code?

- **Will the venue be open overnight?**

The venue will be open from 9am to 6pm each day.

- **Do I need to stay for the whole time?**

**You must check in at the hackathon at 9am on Wed and Thurs morning.** 

Most people will stay for the whole time. Winning teams do because it enables them to get help from mentors. Plus it shows their dedication to the judges - that you’re here to build rather than party all day! You do need to come in-person for the submissions/pitches, and attend all the workshops in-person.

- **Do I need to be an expert in blockchain?**

Nope - if you’ve been accepted for Consensus, we think you have a great shot at winning, so make sure you come and hack with us! We’ll also have experts available to help 24/7, and lots of beginner teams have actually ended up winning before!

- **Will there be vegan and gluten-free food?**

We’ve got you covered! We’ll have plenty of vegan and gluten-free food for you!

- **What should team sizes be?**

1-5 people per team. You can also enter solo, but 5 is the maximum number per team. If you have over 5 people in your team, split up into more than one team (and go for multiple challenges)!

- **Can I participate without coding?**

Yes! If you’re a non-coder you can participate in tons of ways! For example, you can join a technical team to help them (e.g. making the presentation, helping with ideas, or with their economic models).

- **Can I go for all the different prize tracks?**

Yep - you can submit your project for all the tracks! Just make sure you satisfy the challenge criteria for all of them.

**Rules:**

1. Don’t start coding your project before the hackathon officially starts. You can obviously start researching or learning how to use the tools you’ll need, but you must not start coding the project you intend to submit.
2. If you want to use pre-existing code (e.g. from a prior project you’ve made) you must notify us first in person and in writing, with a detailed explanation of which parts you’ll be re-using. You are of course allowed to fork projects (rather than reinventing the wheel). However, your hackathon submission will be judged solely on the merits of what you have achieved during the time of the hackathon itself. If during or after the event we find that you failed to disclose that you used pre-existing code, you will be subject to disqualification. 
3. Your project must remain open source and available on the Github repo you submit (even after the hackathon ends)
4. Final prizes to be awarded at the judges’ discretion
5. All participants are expected to adhere to the following principles:
    1. Integrity: Maintain honesty and transparency in all aspects of the competition. Ensure that your submission consists of citations, references, and code attributions.
    2. Respect: Treat all participants, mentors, and organizers respectfully and courteously.
